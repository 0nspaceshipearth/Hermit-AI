# contributing

want to help out? here's how.

## legal stuff

we need you to sign a contributor license agreement before we can merge your code. the cla lets us distribute your contribution and keeps things clean legally. you keep your copyright, we just get a license to use it.

by opening a pr, you're saying:
- this is your original work
- you can submit it under agpl v3
- you agree to the cla terms in [CLA.md](CLA.md)

## how to contribute

1. fork and branch from `main`
2. run `./setup.sh` to get your environment working
3. make your changes (follow pep 8)
4. test with `python3 test_batch.py`
5. add the agpl v3 header to new files
6. open a pr

## be decent

don't be a jerk. that's basically it.
