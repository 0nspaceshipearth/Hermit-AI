# commercial licensing

hermit is open source under agpl v3. for most people, that's all you need.

but if you're in government, enterprise, or building a proprietary product, you might need a commercial license. here's the difference:

**agpl v3 (free)**
- you have to share your source code if you deploy hermit on a network
- modifications must be open sourced
- community support only

**commercial license (paid)**
- keep your code proprietary
- no source disclosure required
- priority support available

## when you need this

- classified or air-gapped deployments where you can't release source
- embedding hermit into proprietary products
- legal/procurement requirements for large organizations
